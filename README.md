# PartWasherGrid
With an economical magnetic stirrer (or magnetic mixer) and a sealable plastic container from the dollar store, you're most of the way towards a DIY part washer!

The only missing piece is something to keep the part away from the stir bar (the spinning pill-looking thing that sits inside the liquid). This 3D model provides a (sort of) customizable object that does exactly that.

You should be able to print it in whatever you like as long as it will withstand your wash solvent.  PLA doesn't care about soaking in alcohol so it's a good choice.

## 3D Printable Grill Inserts 
Two grill inserts are provided for download (STL files), one that is square (90x90mm or about 3.5 x 3.5") and one rectangular (80x125mm or about 3x5").
They are UNLIKELY to be the exact size you need, but to customize all you need to do is:
1) Measure your container
2) Scale the STL model to match your dimensions
3) Print it out and use it. (They are made to print flat/upside-down on a build platform, no supports or anything needed.)

This will work in most cases because nothing cares whether the holes are perfectly even or not, or whether the legs end up  a little fatter or thinner in one direction or the other.

## Need to Customize More?
The CAD file in STEP format is provided should you wish to muck about with it further.
